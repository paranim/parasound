A library to provide Nim bindings for [miniaudio](https://github.com/dr-soft/miniaudio) and [dr_wav](https://github.com/mackron/dr_libs/blob/master/dr_wav.h), allowing you to play wav and mp3 files, and write wav files. It does *not* attempt to provide any higher-level wrapper. See [the tests](https://github.com/paranim/parasound/blob/master/tests/test1.nim) and [common.nim](https://github.com/paranim/parasound/blob/master/tests/common.nim) for examples of how to use it. On linux, make sure to [link to a few things](https://github.com/paranim/parasound/blob/master/config.nims) that miniaudio requires.
